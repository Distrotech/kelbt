                            C++ Pre-Parser
                            ==============

C++ Pre-Parser is a program for making the analysis and transformation of C++
somewhat easier.  The pre-parser specializes symbols to their various uses,
resolves names to the language entities they represent and adds symbols to the
input. 

The "undo" program is can be used to remove the disambiguation symbols from the
output of CxxPrep.

The TXL grammar file "cpp.grm" includes a rule "undoDisambig" for removing the
disambuation symbols. A skeleton TXL program for use with CxxPrep follows:

include "cpp.grm"

define program
        [cpp_program]
end define

function main
    replace [program]
        P [program]
    by
        P [undoDisambig]
end function

BUILDING CxxPrep
================

CxxPrep requires a recent version of Ragel State Machine compiler.
